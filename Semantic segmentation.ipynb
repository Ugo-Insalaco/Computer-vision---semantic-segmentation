    "## 1. Max pooling\n",
    "Technically it is absolutely possible to replace the max pooling with convolutions of stride 2. In practice this will complexify the model and require a longer time to learn since there will be more parameters. Since there will be more parameters, if we have enough data it could increase the performance but also increase overfitting at the same time"

    "## 2. Skip connections\n",
    "In this architecture skip connections are important to retrieve past lost information during max pooling. It allows to retain details of the picture that can be destroyed when reducing the size of the channels.   \n",
    "If we remove these skip connections we might not be able to have a detailed image in output that fits the current input because when reducing the dimension we average in a sense around patches of pixels of the image so any sharp variation of the picture would be smoothened by the convolutions.  \n",
    "It would totally be possible to change the way we add skip connection by adding it to the current output or using a min max procedure. Intuitively the important part is the keep these skip connection to rememeber the different stages of the output. Changing these skip connection could improve performance."

    "##  3. FCN and Auto-encoder\n",
    "This architecture of auto-encoder is one of many type and not necessary in a sens that we can always construct a model that given an image outputs an image of same size without making use of auto-encoders. During convolutions it is possible to use parameters such that the image size stays the same, for instance with a kernel of 4 and a padding of 2 the image size doesn't change. In practice the auto-encoder architecture is one that gives satisfying results that we can intuitively explain by the fact that the image is reduced to its core features during the encoding so we can catch a global vision of the image."

    "## 4. Threshold for inference\n",
    "In our case we used a threshold to compute true and false negatives and positives. However, here we can defind precision and recall with respect to the \"distance\" to the true mask, for exemple TP could be the sum over each pixel true_mask[i,j] x predicted_mask[i,j] so that if true mask is 1 predicted_mask should be as close to 1 as possible to maximize the sum. Same for TN, FP and FN and then we could compute precision and recall from these."
